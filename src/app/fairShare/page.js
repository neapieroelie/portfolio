                                Onward is an AI-powered web application designed to support immigrant nurses who are new to North Americaâ€™s healthcare industry.
                                It addresses cultural and language gaps while helping users build their confidence. With Onward, nurses can prepare for interviews
                                through realistic mock interview simulations tailored to the healthcare sector, receive comprehensive feedback, and review past
                                sessions to refine their responses and enhance their skills.

                            We chose to focus on immigrants because many of our team members, either personally or through family and friends, understand the challenges they face when transitioning to a new professional environment. These include cultural and language barriers, biases against international qualifications, and the emotional strain of starting over.
                            <br/><br/>Through surveys and secondary research, we found these challenges were especially pronounced in healthcare:
                            <li>
                                44% of internationally educated healthcare workers are overqualified but often overlooked.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Over 25% of immigrants experience severe interview anxiety, limiting their ability to showcase their skills.
                            </li>
                            <br/>This inspired us to create a solution tailored to immigrant nurses' needs, helping them overcome these barriers.

                            We identified a gap in resources for nurses to practice their interview skills, particularly those tailored to the immigrant community. 
                            
                            <br/><br/>To address this, we developed Onward, an application where nurses can:
                            <li>
                                Practice responses tailored to their job postings and resumes.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Use the Mock Interview feature, which replicates real interviews with randomized questions 
                                to test their readiness under realistic conditions.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Receive instant feedback analyzing clarity, relevance, and language use, 
                                with suggestions to improve answer structure, such as using the STAR method.
                            </li>
                            <br/>These features empower users to communicate more confidently and effectively, 
                            ensuring they are well-prepared for real-world interviews.
